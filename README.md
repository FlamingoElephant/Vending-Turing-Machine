# Vending-Turing-Machine

Group Project - 04.07.23 Create a program using any programming language that demonstrates how a vending machine accepts or rejects an input string, utilizing a deterministic single-tape Turing machine and register machines for computational operations. The vending machine in question has four items (napkins, knives, forks, and spoons) and only accepts three types of Jamaican coins denoted by symbols: $5 (α), $10 (β), and $20 (γ). At the beginning, the machine has 20 of each item, with different prices for each item: $10 for napkins, $25 for knives, $15 for forks, and $20 for spoons. The customer will input acceptable money and select which item(s) they want. The Turing machine will then read the input and check if the amount of money entered is sufficient to purchase the requested item(s) and if the items are in stock. The machine will either dispense the requested item(s), refund money for insufficient funds, refund money for an out-of-stock item, or reject the string for incorrect user input. The owner of the vending machine can collect funds and restock the machine using the input string NKSFFSKS. The program should also record the funds obtained from sales and what is left in stock in a file with a timestamp, and the till should return to zero with the starting inventory of each item. The developer should specify how to stop the machine.
